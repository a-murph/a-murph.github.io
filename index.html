		<p>Andrew has been coding in some capacity since high school, though he has never been able to break past the beginner stages and into more advanced work. He spent about 6 months trying to teach himself web development before deciding to enroll in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. He has some experience with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and the Laravel Framework for PHP. In his free time he likes to play video games such as Monster Hunter and Final Fantasy, watch anime, and watch YouTube analysis videos.</p>
