			I have been coding in some capacity since high school; I attended a 2-week bootcamp-like summer camp that introduced me to C++ and Java, and then took Intro to Computer Science in school the following year. My senior year of high school I took an AP Computer Science course that expanded on my knowledge of Java, and I completed the Computer Science AP Test with a score of 4 (out of 5.)
		</p>
		<p>
			After completing one year of a Computer Science major at the University of New Haven, I decided that I didn't perform at my best in a college environment. After doing some thinking I decided to start getting into Web Development, as it seemed like a more useful and applicable branch of programming going forward than standalone application development.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spent about 6 months trying to teach myself Web Development. In this time I gained a pretty solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and learned a little bit of JavaScript. I also put time into learning PHP and the Laravel framework and made decent progress towards understanding them, building a basic blog website and database search system using primarily Laravel-driven PHP, as well as a MySQL database.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually however, I felt like I was starting to hit a wall in my learning, and decided to look for a more formal, structured program to learn Web Development. I quickly found the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and was enticed by the very low cost and short timeframe relative to a traditional four-year college program. Being that I feel like I work best in a highly-focused, fast-paced learning environment, I signed up with little hesitation.

			I am somewhat of a perfectionist, and I like to keep things I'm doing organized. I'm the kind of person who maintains a spreadsheet of every game I've ever played and the score I would give them. If I don't run into any major interruptions I can work on a given project continuously for hours on end without burning out.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm not programming, I spend most of my free time together with my significant other, with whom I live. I like to play Playstation 4 and PC games (some of my favorites being Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts 2, and InFamous 2) and watch anime (some of my favorites being Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Parasyte) but I like to break it up with some exercise to stay somewhat in shape. I also periodically meet online with friends to play games like Monster Hunter World or Dungeons & Dragons.
